# Theater_Model_DB_Management

DB Management Assignment


This assignment is completed using Java language and MySQL database.

Given the attached CSV file listing movie showtimes, please store its contents in a database so that
other developers can create a Web app to query local theater showtimes.
In this process we would like you to perform as many of the following steps as you can using your
preferred programming language, and using MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite as your database software.
All code to perform the entire process should be included as a zip file using zip/gzip or some other
common archiving format. We expect to be able to unzip the file and use the included files to run the
created code and generate the database tables.


Tasks:
1. Create a database and database table that will be used to store the contents of the CSV file.
Please include all SQL commands used to do so.
2. Create a program to parse and store the CSV data in the database table from #1.
3. Write a SQL select statement to return the theater chain, theatre name, movie title, showtimes,
and attributes for all “Regal” theaters.
4. Now assume you will be getting much larger CSV files. Rewrite the database schema to use
multiple relational tables to reduce data duplication where possible.
5. Create another program that will parse the CSV file and store the data in the new database
schema from #4.
6. Write a SQL select statement to return the theater chain, theatre name, movie title, showtimes,
and attributes for all “Regal” theaters.
7. Include a readme file describing how to execute all the above steps. This should be clear
enough so we can go through the above steps to recreate the database and tables. Also, include
an explanation of the database schema and programs included.
